# Tiny Web Server

## Purpose
An example of a Tiny Scala WebServer in as little as code as possible.

## Reason
The reason behind this project was actually for a Job interview nearly 12 years ago for a Scala job.
Sadly, they ghosted me and so I haven't touched it since. People appear to like this project and reach out to me so I've decided to update it.
